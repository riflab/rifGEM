# About rifGEM
Geophysical Electromagnetic Modeling is a software code for calculating Forward Modeling Magnetotelluric. 

Current proggres Version 1.0_20171121 1D Forward Modelling Magnetotelluric. 

Next, rifGEMM will be upgraded for 2D and 3D Forward Modeling and Inversion.

## Tutorial

1. Intall Python and library
2. Run the python code
3. You can chenge parameters (`Maximum Period, Number of decade, Periode per Decade, Resistivity Value, Thickness`)
4. Then, clik `Run`
5. You can also `Save Model` and `Save Data`
6. Enjoy for educational purposes only
